How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpretting user needs nad implementing them into a program starts with understanding where the user is coming from, 
and what do they ultimately seek out of this app or product. Generally, identifying those key objectives, we can
then begin to understand what features would be required, and exactly how they should be implemented.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I approach developing by one step at a time, agile methodology includes alot of adapative thinking, and communicating. So as my future development work becomes present, 
I will take charge on communicating with my peers, and being able to structure my code in a way that is buildable rather than having to cement a whole program with it
being not exactly what is needed or required.
